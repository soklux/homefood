# Installation

Installation of Yii mainly involves the following two steps:
1. Download Yii1 Framework from [yiiframework.com](https://www.yiiframework.com/download#yii1)
2. Unpack the Yii release file to a Web-accessible directory.
 
Tip: Yii does not need to be installed under a Web-accessible directory. A Yii application has one entry script which is usually the only file that needs to be exposed to Web users. Other PHP scripts, including those from Yii, should be protected from Web access; otherwise they might be exploited by hackers.
