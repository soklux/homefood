# Prerequisites

To run a Yii1-powered Web application, you need a Web server that supports PHP 5.1.0.

For developers who want to use Yii, understanding object-oriented programming (OOP) is very helpful, because Yii is a pure OOP framework.

After installing Yii, you may want to verify that your server satisfies Yii’s requirements. You can do so by accessing the requirement checker script via the following URL in a Web browser:

http://hostname/path/to/yii/requirements/index.php

Yii1 requires PHP 5.1, so the server must have PHP 5.1 or above installed and available to the web server. Yii has been tested with Apache HTTP server on Windows and Linux. It may also run on other Web servers and platforms, provided PHP 5.1 is supported.
